            <img src="profile-picture.jpg" alt="Profile photo" class="profile-photo">
            <p>Hi, My name is Pranay Kusakula, and I am a passionate and driven individual with a strong background in computer science and engineering. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Computer and Information Sciences at Sacred Heart University, further expanding my knowledge and skills in this dynamic field.</p>

            <p>My journey began at Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, data structures, and software development methodologies. I actively participated in various projects and hackathons, honing my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills.</p>

            <p>Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have cultivated a deep appreciation for the power of technology and its potential to positively impact society. I am particularly interested in areas such as artificial intelligence, web development, Mysql, and I am continuously seeking opportunities to learn and grow in these domains.</p>

            <p>What sets me apart is my unwavering dedication to continuous learning and my ability to adapt to new technologies quickly. I thrive in collaborative environments, where I can contribute my skills and learn from others. I am a natural problem-solver, with a keen eye for detail and a knack for breaking down complex issues into manageable components.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I enjoy upgrading my skills, which not only provide a refreshing balance but also foster creativity and critical thinking.</p>

            <p>I am excited about the prospect of contributing my knowledge and enthusiasm to innovative projects and collaborating with like-minded individuals. Feel free to explore my portfolio to gain a deeper understanding of my skills, experiences, and achievements</p>

            <h5>Technical Skills</h5>
            <p>Python, Java, C++, web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks like React or Angular, databases, cloud platforms, mysql. </p>

                    <h4>Online Rehashed Book Store System.</h4>
                    <p>In present days, books will help more and more to the people who want to gain knowledge. Even through the era of e-book reading, people still wish to stay back at the perks of reading a real book. But the high prices of getting a printed book and the time it takes to grab a few books from a nearby library possess problems for a person. So, building an “Online Rehashed Book Store System” where the online web Application indexes all the available book titles from the nearby libraries from where a person can login to the website to rent a book from the library for a period of time and pay the library accordingly and also the user can buy second hand books from the vendors listed in the website. The user can choose from the list of books, check the availability of books in nearby libraries, rent the book for a period of time, return the book on time to avoid penalty rate the books after the rent period is over and provide reviews about the books. The application also tracks the users reading history.</p>

                    <h4>Email Based Spam Detection.</h4>
		    <p>Nowadays, a big part of people relies on available email or messages sent by
the stranger. The possibility that anybody can leave an email or a message
provides a golden opportunity for spammers to write spam message about
our different interests. Spam fills inbox with number of ridiculous emails.
Degrades our internet speed to a great extent .Steals useful information like
our details on our contact list. Identifying these spammers and also the
spam content can be a hot topic of research and laborious tasks. Email spam
is an operation to send messages in bulk by mail. Since the expense of the
spam is borne mostly by the recipient, it is effectively postage due
advertising. Spam email is a kind of commercial advertising which is
economically viable because email could be a very cost-effective medium for
sender. With this proposed model the specified message can be stated as
spam or not using Bayes theorem and Naive Bayes Classifier and Also IP
addresses of the sender are often detected.</p>

                    <h4>Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM and GRU.</h4>
                    <p>The stock market is a highly complex nonlinear movement system, and its fluctuation law is affected by many factors, so the prediction of the stock price index is a very challenging task. There are many examples showing that Neural Network algorithms are well suited for such time series predictions and often achieve satisfactory results. In this paper, based on the existing models, we proposed a Regularized GRU- LSTM neural network model and applied it to the short-term forecast of closing price of the two stocks. The experimental results show that our proposed model is superior to the existing GRU and LSTM network models in stock time series prediction.</p>
